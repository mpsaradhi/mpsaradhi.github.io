OBJECTIVES:To give students an introduction to elementary probability theory, in preparation for courses on statistical
analysis, random variables and stochastic processes.
To mathematically model the random phenomena with the help of probability theory concepts.
To introduce the important concepts of random variables and stochastic processes.
To analyze the LTI systems with stationary random process as input.
To introduce the types of noise and modelling noise sources.
OUTCOMES:

After completion of the course, the student will be able to

Mathematically model the random phenomena and solve simple probabilistic problems.
Identify different types of random variables and compute statistical averages of these random variables.
Characterize the random processes in the time and frequency domains.
Analyze the LTI systems with random inputs.
Apply these techniques to analyze the systems in the presence of different types of noise.
