Laboratory experiments demonstrating material taught in Analog Comminication course. Use is made of spectrum analysis to study baseband signals and Software Defined Radio (RTL-SDR) . Topics include AM, FM, PM, sampling, pre-emphasis & de-emphasis, Pulse modulation & demodulation, PLL, receiver characteristics and complete communication systems.
Corequisite: Analog Communications
