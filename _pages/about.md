I am faculty of Electronics and Communications Engineering at Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology (VVIT), Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India. I am also NVIDIA DLI University Ambassador committed to teach DLI instructor-led workshops and meetups at universities,
academic conferences, and events at no cost exclusively for academic student and staff.

Prior to my move to VVIT, I was faculty of ECE in Vignan's Engineering College. I obtained my M.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology  Kharagpur and my B.Tech from JUNTH.
