Read the full article "Quest of Life" to be published in VVIT Magazine - 2018

In every walk of our life we experience one of the three states of our mind - excitement, anxiety and peace. If you are excited that means you are living in the past enjoying your success so far, and anxiety indicates you are living in future imagining of what you want to become. You are at peace when you live in present and you live in present only when you are learning something out of that moment. Learning means just learning without having the fear of facing exams.

Curiosity drives our quest to learn new things and keeps us at peace. Student age is one such period where peace has to prevail more than the excitement and the anxiety. Busy and bored of curriculum thrusted upon there could be at least few moments, while looking up into sky, one is curios of seeking answers to questions like “What is? Who am I?”

More elaborately “What is this universe? Where it came from? Who created it? What is the purpose of life? Who am I? What is the purpose of my existence?” As the questions range from ‘Universe (macro – materialistic form of life which includes everything that we could perceive)’ to the ‘I (micro – non materialistic form of life, an individual)’, unaware of how and where to dig for answers, one would turn to religions, philosophers, scientists, technologists and so on. This article is the summary of discourses I happened to learn from one of my scholarly  friend who read a lot.

Quest of Life

Philosophers are the seekers of wisdom whereas scientists are the seekers of evidence (materialistic) bestowing that wisdom. Religions, philosophies, science and technology, all of them study both macrocosm and microcosm. Even though microcosm is introduced ages ago by Kanada maharshi (కణాద  మహర్షి), a propound philosopher of our nation, its progress is meagre in a more scientific way due to the lack of scientific tools to prove it.  Almost all scientists and researchers up to 18th century concentrated on macrocosm, but with the development of technology some of them started doing research on microcosm also.

After studying metaphysics, world history, western and eastern philosophy, mysticism, six systems of Indian philosophy (Vedanta philosophy particularly), Shakespeare, Bertrend Russel, Swami Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, Subhash Chandra Bose, AuroBindo, Sri Krishna Devaraya, Balagangadara Tilak etc., I (my friend) understand that macrocosm and microcosm are two facets of the same coin yet different. Some of the studies which started with microcosm ended in macrocosm and other studies vice versa, thus forming a full circle. History has given evidence for both of these half circles.

Socrates, Plato, Aristotle - these three people developed metaphysical concepts, the result of their philosophy was Alexander (who is a blood thirsty warrior) which is the case of philosophy converted in to materialism. After a destructive lethal war with Kalinga the vengeful Emperor Ashoka transformed to a stable and peaceful emperor and became a patron of Buddhism is the bear witness of the other half of the circle which is the conversion of materialism into philosophy.

World has seen the emergence of different philosophies at different times in various parts of the globe. In 600B.C Greek philosophy and Roman Philosophy; in 400 B.C Faith and knowledge (Scholasticism); in 15th century Renaissance; in 17th century rationalism, Empiricism (Understanding of Science); in 18th century Enlightenment (Critiques of Religion); in 19th century German idealism, materialism, values, positivism and pragmatism; in 20th century technology reached its zenith.

At the same time mysticism has its share of thought continuously citing the energies of the other worlds and their strong influences on our lives at every stage - from birth to death and some times even after death. Such energies we can’t perceive by our naked eyes and we can’t measure using any tool. Max Planck, Vaander Waals, Botlzman, Joule, Clasius, Nersnest, Gibbs and others tried to develop mathematical equations to quantify such energies also.

Consequences of all these historical events tells us chronicles concerning how philosophy is converted in to science and that science in to technology. But those basic questions “who am I? What is the purpose of life?” still remain unanswered and unexplained to the individuals either by religions, philosophers or scientists. If at all answered, that is for even worse to the seeker as there are many conflicting answers resulting in more chaotic life.

In 1665, British scientist Robert Hooke peered through a microscope at a paper-thin slice of cork and saw it was “all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb.” He named the structures “cells,” and revolutionized the study of life on Earth. In the film ‘Lucy (2014)’ when she becomes more and more aware (higher brain utilization), she loses her emotions and ability to feel. Logic takes over. The next question she has is - what is the purpose of life? Prof. Norman answers her question and I quote “If you're asking me what to do... you know, if you think about the very nature of life, I mean, from the very beginning, the development of the first cell that divided into two cells. The sole purpose of life has been to pass on what was learned. There was no higher purpose. So if you're asking me what to do with all this knowledge you're accumulating, I'd say pass it on. Just like any simple cell going through time.”

No matter from how long this higher purpose is practiced by life on earth and how much knowledge may be gathered in that process, incapable of identifying truth, one would easily be driven into more dilemma by those countless conflicting ideas from philosophers and never be satisfying evidences from the scientists.

We constantly rely upon others to provide tools for the identification of truth in the available answers.  Scientists consistently promise to develop such tools in near future that never comes, philosophers believe that the volumes of theory they have developed are the required tools and on the other hand religions setup the rituals as its tools which are often not in agreement with one another. All of them remain to be of no use to the seeker because most of them were developed thinking that everybody is exactly identical and the truth that they are seeking is static. But in reality seekers are different from one another and truth is as dynamic as time and also like flow of water in a river not having an associated time stamp.

Not to despair, instead of allowing others tools to guide us, one should turn the combination of his/her body, heart, mind and soul into one’s own tool and remain attentive to whatever comes in life because one should learn to find the truth from one’s own experiences no matter how easy or how difficult it may become, how early or how long it may take as truth thus found by the seeker is the truth that the seeker is ever seeking and such truth is a pathless land.
